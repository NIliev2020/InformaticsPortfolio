                    <p>Hello! My name is Nikolay Iliev and I am an 18-year-old student at the American College of Sofia; section 12/6. My hobby is drawing and playing computer games. I live at the center of Sofia and frequently go out with friends. During the summer, I go windsurfing as well as participate in karting races. Sports gave me an opportunity to improve my teamwork skills which contributes to my successful academic performance. </p>
